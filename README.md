Containerized Microservices Application with Docker Compose

Your team is developing a containerized microservices-based application that needs to
be deployed andmanaged using open-source technologies. The application should be
designed for easy local development and testing using Docker Compose.
#### Task
Design and implement a containerized microservices application using Docker
Compose. The application should consist of multiple interconnected microservices, each
running in its container and communicating. Set up an essential monitoring and
logging solution using open-source tools (e.g., Prometheus and Grafana, ELK stack) to
ensure visibility into the application's performance and health.
### Follow-up Meeting
In the follow-up meeting, demonstrate your Docker Compose-based microservices
application, explain your design decisions, and showcase how the monitoring and
logging system contributes to maintaining the application's reliability and
performance. Be prepared to discuss using FOSS technologies and the benefits of
avoiding vendor lock-in.
